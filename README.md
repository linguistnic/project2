### Thank you for choosing The YU-GI-OH! Card Search!

This project could not have been done without the endless support of my friends and family. I am so very humbled, always. Halfway through the bootcamp, you guys!! Especially big shout out to my mom for sitting and listening to me meticulously talk through every single line of code, even though she doesn't know how to code. You're the best, mom!

In this project you'll find a Yu-Gi-Oh! name search, which was written using HTML, CSS, SCSS, and JS. It will render the title, image, description, attack value, and defense value. The Yu-Gi-Oh! card game is near and dear to me, because of countless nights spent playing with friends or hours spent looking up strategies. (I plan to use this project for my own benefit as well).

In the future, I would have liked to spend time changing some things:

1) Creating an option to display only one kind of monster.

2) Creating a more responsive design and incorporating a lot more grid elements.

3) Making multiple pages that, in theory, could show only one card at a time with all stats.

All in all, though, I am extremely proud of this project, and am quite honestly shocked I've made it this far in the bootcamp. I'm really falling in love with creating interactive, useful, and optimized art projects (web sites), and it's reignited a passion inside of me that I am excited to push to its limits.

Thank you! And please enjoy the search engine! May it help you with all of your Yu-Gi-Oh! needs.

Much love!
